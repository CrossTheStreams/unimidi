= UniMIDI

== Summary

Platform independent realtime MIDI input and output for Ruby.

== Features

* Platform independent.  Currently Linux, Windows and Cygwin are supported. More platforms will follow (see "to-do")
* Both input and output to and from multiple devices concurrently
* Agnostically handle different MIDI Message types (including SysEx)

== Requirements

Platform

* JRuby: {midi-jruby}[http://github.com/arirusso/midi-jruby]
* Linux: {alsa-rawmidi}[http://github.com/arirusso/alsa-rawmidi]
* Windows/Cygwin: {midi-winmm}[http://github.com/arirusso/midi-winmm] 

Note that if you are using JRuby you must be in 1.9 mode.  This is normally accomplished by passing --1.9 to JRuby at the command line.
